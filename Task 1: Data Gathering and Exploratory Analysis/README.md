# Data Gathering and Exploratory Analysis
## Overview
Integrated and synthesized five banking columns (Demographics, Transactions, Service, Activity, and Status) into a unified 1,000-record master dataset for churn analysis. With the help of AI I implemented a "Data Quality Assurance" pipeline by using median imputation to replace missing values, removed outliers from the dataset, cleaned the dataset and used standard scaling to ensure my dataset has a non-biased foundation for predictive modeling operations that would follow.
