# Lloyds Banking Group Virtual Job Sim - Data Science
Completed through The Forage (https://www.theforage.com/)

## 🎯 Project Overview
Acted as a Data Science Graduate for SmartBank (a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group) to address declining retention rates among young professionals and small business owners. I developed a Customer Retention Enhancement framework by building a classification model to identify "at-risk" customers, allowing the bank to move from reactive management to proactive, targeted interventions.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Data Science:** Classification Modeling, Data Wrangling, Imbalance Handling (SMOTE/Class Weighting), Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling.
* **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn) and Jupyter Notebooks.
* **Domain Knowledge:** Retail Banking, Customer Churn Analysis and Predictive Analytics.
* **Soft Skills:** Stakeholder communication, analytical thinking and problem solving.

## 📈 Key Tasks & Contributions
1. **Task 1: - Data gathering and exploratory analysis** - 
2. **Task 2:** - Building a Machine Learning Model.

# Conclusion
**Focus:** Churn Prevention & Systems Optimization

The "Customer Retention Enhancement" initiative demonstrated the power of data-driven intervention in retail banking. By resolving a critical 4:1 class imbalance using SMOTE and deploying a Random Forest model with 91% recall, the project provides SmartBank with a highly sensitive tool for revenue protection.
* **Business Impact:** The model identifies the vast majority of at-risk "Young Professionals" and "Small Business Owners" before they exit, allowing the Marketing team to deploy targeted loyalty incentives that maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
* **Systems Engineering Value:** Optimized the customer lifecycle by identifying Login Frequency as a primary systemic failure point. This insight allows for a structural shift in product strategy to increase digital engagement and reduce "retention waste."
